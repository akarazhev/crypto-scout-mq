# Issue 12: Check and fix error and warning messages in logs

The first version of the `crypto-scout-mq` project has been done now. Let's check and fix `error` and `warning`
messages in logs to be sure that the project is ready for production and there are no issues. I will upload log messages
to you below.

## Roles

Take the following roles:

- Expert dev-opts engineer.
- Expert technical writer.

## Conditions

- Use the best practices and design patterns.
- Use the current technological stack, that's: `ActiveJ 6.0` and `Java 25`.
- Use the current technology stack, that's: `rabbitmq:4.1.4-management`, `podman 5.6.2`, `podman-compose 1.5.0`.
- Configuration is `rabbitmq/definitions.json`, `rabbitmq/enabled_plugins`, `rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`,
  `podman-compose.yml`, `secret/rabbitmq.env.example`, `secret/README.md`.
- Do not hallucinate.

## Tasks

- As the `expert dev-opts engineer` check and fix `error` and `warning` messages in logs to be sure that the project is 
  ready for production and there are no issues. 
- As the `expert dev-opts engineer` recheck your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed any
  important points.
- As the `expert technical writer` update the `README.md` and `rabbitmq-production-setup.md` files with your results.
- As the `expert technical writer` update the `12-check-fix-logging.md` file with your resolution.

## Findings (2025-10-24)

- **Errors**: none observed during startup and definitions import.
- **Warnings**:
    - **Erlang cookie override**: `Overriding Erlang cookie using the value set in the environment` — expected when
      using `RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE` from `./secret/rabbitmq.env`.
    - **Peer discovery (single node)**:
      `Classic peer discovery backend: list of nodes does not contain the local node []` — benign on first boot; caused
      by empty classic_config node list.
    - **Message store index rebuild**: expected on first boot/clean data dir.

## Fixes applied

- File: `rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`
    - Added explicit classic peer discovery for a single node to suppress the benign warning:
        - `cluster_formation.peer_discovery_backend = classic_config`
        - `cluster_formation.classic_config.nodes.1 = rabbit@crypto_scout_mq`
- No changes to `podman-compose.yml`, `rabbitmq/enabled_plugins`, or topology files.

## Verification

1) Restart the service:

```bash
./script/rmq_compose.sh restart
```

2) Inspect recent logs for the last 200 lines:

```bash
./script/rmq_compose.sh logs -n 200
```

Expected results:

- No classic peer discovery warning about missing local node.
- Listeners active on `5672`, `5552`, `15672`, `15692`.
- Definitions imported without errors.

3) Validate Prometheus endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:15692/metrics | head
```

## Impact and notes

- Management UI may display limited/less granular rates since its metrics collection is disabled;
  `management.rates_mode=basic` remains for responsiveness.
- Prometheus is the primary observability path; dashboards/alerts should be built off `:15692/metrics`.
- The Erlang cookie override message remains informational and expected.
- Index rebuild warning is expected only on first boot or when data directory is clean.

## Documentation updates

- `doc/rabbitmq-production-setup.md`: updated config snippet and readiness review; added "Log verification (2025-10-24)"
  and "Logging remediation (2025-10-24)" sections.

## Status

- Resolved. Startup is clean of actionable warnings; system ready for production with Prometheus as the source of truth
  for metrics.
